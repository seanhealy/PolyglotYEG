    <h1>Vision</h1>
    <p>Polyglot: knowing or using several languages.  We hope to gather Edmonton software developers who will leave language, platform and possibly even editor wars behind and come together for a spontaneously organized day of amazing talks, round-table discussions, panel sessions, and coding.  If you've never been to an unconference (or open-space) event before, you owe it to yourself to make it to Polyglot YEG. It's an experience like no other.</p>

    <p>This event is inspired by the <a href="https://www.polyglotconf.com/">Polyglot Unconference</a> in Vancouver.</p>

    <h1>How it works</h1>
    <p>Open-space unconferences are spontaneously scheduled and 100% attendee-driven. Sessions will be proposed and selected at the opening of the conference.</p>

    <p>In the morning attendees can propose or request a session by filling out a provided sheet like so:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Topic:       ____________</li>
        <li>Proposed by: ____________</li>
        <li>Format:      ____________</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>Sessions will then be selected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-voting" target="_blank">dot voting</a>. PolyglotYEG gremlins will put together the schedule based on the votes.</p>

    <p>
      Example sessions:

    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
    <p>Polyglot YEG isn't the product of some faceless corporation looking to make a buck by getting you to a conference and then selling you a time-share. The organizers are all community members from around Edmonton: just like you! We saw a lot of user groups for Javascript, Ruby, Python, functional languages, .net, etc. but very few places where developers from different communities could get together. We hope that Polyglot YEG will be that place: a place for technologists to get together and talk about the craft.</p>

    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
    <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at Polyglot YEG are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.</p>
